# Discovering Good anf Safer Pubs for Women


### Context:

London is well-known for its pubs. With more than 3500 pubs in the city,  it can be expected to be part of a Londoner life. 

It is not different for Londoner women, as they represent 48% of all pubs consumers. 

But women might feel uncomfortable and unsafe to be out at night in pubs, since pubs can be male-dominant environments. 

To address this issue, this project aims to predict good and safer pubs for women, through clustering.
